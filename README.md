Welcome to the official API for the [Just Arrived](http://www.justarrived.se/) matching service.

The API tries to follow the [JSON API 1.0](http://jsonapi.org/) standard, but is still a long way from completely compliant. Feel free to report any violations.

## Docs

__Public JSON API documentation__

[Docs for the current version of the API](http://just-match-api.herokuapp.com/).

The API documentation is generated right where the code for that particular endpoint is.
That way the documentation is kept up to date.

During development you can run find the documentation at `http://localhost:5000/`, as long as you have a started your server (you start it by running `script/server`).

You can generate a static version of the API documentation with

```
$ script/docs
```

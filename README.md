Welcome to the, very unofficial, API backend for Just Arrived. Everything in this
project is open source and licensed under the permissive [MIT](LICENSE.txt) license.

The API is designed to be consumed by multiple clients and the goal is that it should bevery easy to implement a client (Web/Android/iOS etc..).

The API tries to follow the [JsonApi 1.0](http://jsonapi.org/) standard, but is definetly not completely compliant yet. Please feel free to report any violations.

:warning: _Note_: The project it still in a very early stage and drastic changes to the API can be made at any time. If your thinking of doing a larger contribution please open an issue so it can be discussed (things can move real fast now in the beginning without much public discussion).
